Which of the following summaries does a better job of summarizing the most important points in the given news article, without including unimportant or irrelevant details? A good summary is both precise and concise.
Post: """{instruction}"""
Summary A:
{
    "model": "model_1",
    "summary": """{output_1}"""
}
Summary B:
{
    "model": "model_2",
    "summary": """{output_2}"""
}

Now please rank the models by the quality of their summaries, so that the model with rank 1 has the best summary. Then return a list of the model names and ranks, i.e., produce the following output:
[
    {'model': <model-name>, 'rank': <model-rank>},
    {'model': <model-name>, 'rank': <model-rank>}
]

Your response must be a valid Python dictionary and should contain nothing else because we will directly execute it in Python. Please provide the ranking that the majority of humans would give.
